CloudCannon — a popular Git-based CMS for static site generators — has announced full support for Astro, with live visual editing ready to set up for all Astro sites.

With this release, Astro users can design and configure their ideal editing interface for new and existing Astro projects within CloudCannon, with options available for intuitive no-code interfaces for non-technical teams, as well as publishing and reviewing workflows for large organizations.

To get started with CloudCannon as your Astro CMS, create a CloudCannon account and follow the instructions at their Astro Starter Guide. In brief, you’ll need to:

Sync your Astro site files from GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket. Any changes you make in CloudCannon will be pushed back to your Astro repository.
Build and configure your site. (Note that CloudCannon Collections correspond neatly to Astro Content Collections.) You can also configure your inputs and structures, which will let you create page builders or configurable navigations for your sites.
Set up visual editing. With CloudCannon’s visual data previews and Astro’s client-side hydration you can listen for changes in CloudCannon and update your content on the page automatically. Tagging elements with CloudCannon’s visual data bindings allows you to attach a UI directly to the elements on the page within the CMS’s Visual Editor, giving site users an intuitive editing interface.
For Astro users with MDX components, CloudCannon supports embedding rich Snippets in Markdown content — allowing content editors to use structured components without touching the underlying code.

Finally, CloudCannon has also released a stylish new Astro theme, Sendit, which is preconfigured for live visual editing. It includes twenty pre-styled components, available both in the Astro Themes directory, and for immediate deployment on CloudCannon.
