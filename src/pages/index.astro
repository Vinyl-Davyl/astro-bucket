			<h3>Start Building</h3>
			<p>
				Astroâ€™s goal is to be accessible to every web developer. Astro was designed to feel familiar and approachable regardless of skill level or past experience with web development.
				We started by making sure that you could use any favorite UI component languages that you already know. React, Preact, Svelte, Vue, Solid, Lit, and several others are all supported for creating new UI components in an Astro project.
